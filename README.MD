# HW2 - Overlapping Sliding Windows Anomaly Detection

## Overview
This project implements a threshold-based anomaly detection method using overlapping sliding windows (step size = 1) on a Nitrate time series dataset. The method computes a q-percentile threshold within each window to classify data points as normal or anomalous.

## How to Use

### Quick Start 

First, install a Python 3 virtual environment with:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv python_venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source python_venv/bin/activate
```

To fulfill all the requirements for the Python server, you need to run:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running
1. Make sure to follow the quick start to download needed packages
2. Ensure `AG_NO3_fill_cells_remove_NAN-2.csv` is in the same directory
3. Run the script with:
```bash
python3 anomaly_detection.py
```

## Justification

### Chosen W (Window Size = 1000)

A window size of **1000** was selected based on the following considerations:

1. **Balance between local and global context**: A window of 1000 data points provides sufficient historical context to establish a robust baseline for normal behavior while remaining adaptive to local trends in the time series.

2. **Computational efficiency**: With a dataset of approximately 30,790 points, a window size of 1000 allows for reasonable computation time while maintaining good detection performance.

3. **Empirical validation**: Through experimentation with various window sizes (500-2000), W=1000 achieved the best balance between:
   - Avoiding over-sensitivity (too small windows create excessive false positives)
   - Maintaining responsiveness (too large windows may miss localized anomaly patterns)

4. **Statistical robustness**: A sample size of 1000 points provides statistically stable percentile estimates that are less susceptible to noise and outliers compared to smaller windows.

5. **Time series characteristics**: The Nitrate data exhibits both short-term fluctuations and longer-term trends. A window of 1000 captures approximately one seasonal/behavioral cycle based on visual inspection of the data patterns.

### Chosen q (Percentile = 84.5)

A percentile threshold of **84.5%** was selected for the following reasons:

1. **Target accuracy optimization**: Through systematic experimentation, q=84.5 achieved:
   - Normal accuracy: **81.10%** (exceeds 80% target)
   - Anomaly accuracy: **78.01%** (exceeds 75% target)

2. **One-sided upper-tail detection**: Since anomalies in Nitrate levels are primarily characterized by abnormally high values (spikes), a one-sided upper-tail threshold is appropriate. The 84.5th percentile marks the boundary between normal variation and abnormal spikes.

3. **False positive/negative trade-off**: Lower percentiles (e.g., 75-80) resulted in too many false positives, while higher percentiles (e.g., 95-99) missed true anomalies. The 84.5th percentile strikes an optimal balance.

4. **Data distribution characteristics**: Visual inspection and statistical analysis of the Nitrate data revealed that the upper 15.5% of values within local windows often correspond to genuine anomalous events rather than natural variation.

## Design Choices

### Threshold Strategy
- **One-sided upper-tail detection**: Only values **greater than or equal to** the computed threshold are marked as anomalies, as the ground truth anomalies primarily represent abnormally high Nitrate levels.

### NaN Handling
- The provided dataset `AG_NO3_fill_cells_remove_NAN.csv` already has NaNs removed and cells filled, so no additional preprocessing was required.

### Labeling Strategy
- **First window**: All points in window [0, W-1] are labeled using threshold T₁
- **Subsequent windows**: Only the newly added point at index i+W-2 is labeled using the threshold Tᵢ computed from the current window

### Percentile Computation
- Used `numpy.percentile(..., method="linear")` as required for consistent and reproducible threshold calculation.

## Results

### Confusion Matrix (Point-Level)

```
TP (True Positive):  110  
FP (False Positive): 5793  
FN (False Negative): 31  
TN (True Negative):  24856  
```

### Totals

```
P (Total Anomalies): 141  
N (Total Normals):   30649  
```

### Accuracy Metrics

```
Normal Event Detection Accuracy:  81.10% (TN/N) ✓ PASS  
Anomaly Event Detection Accuracy: 78.01% (TP/P) ✓ PASS  
```

Both accuracy targets are achieved: **Normal ≥ 80%** and **Anomaly ≥ 75%**.

### Event-Level Clarification

The assignment description notes there are **77 anomaly events** in total.  
However, when applying event-level counting (collapsing consecutive anomalous points into single events) to the provided dataset (`Student_Flag` labels), we obtain:

- Ground truth anomaly events: **134**  
- Predicted anomaly events: **1325**

This indicates that the distributed dataset marks anomalies more granularly than the “77 events” referenced in the instructions. Our detector, while sensitive to spikes, often fragments larger anomaly clusters into many smaller detected events.

For grading purposes, **all TP/FP/FN/TN metrics and accuracy rates are reported at the point level**, consistent with the rubric (141 anomalous points total). The event-level results are included here for completeness.

### Figure

![Anomaly Detection Results](anomaly_detection_results.png)

*Figure 1: Nitrate time series with detected anomalies (red X markers) and ground truth anomalies (orange circles). Blue dots represent normal data points. The visualization highlights successful detection of major anomaly clusters, including spikes around indices 5000, 12000–16000, and 30000.*

## Key Observations

1. **Major anomaly clusters detected**: The algorithm successfully identifies the three main anomaly regions visible in the time series:
   - Early spike cluster (around index 5000)
   - Large central spike region (indices 12000-16000)
   - Late spike cluster (around index 30000)

2. **Adaptive thresholding**: The sliding window approach allows the threshold to adapt to local baseline changes, making it effective across different regions of the time series.

3. **Trade-off consideration**: While false positives exist, they are acceptable given the critical nature of detecting actual anomalies in Nitrate monitoring applications.
